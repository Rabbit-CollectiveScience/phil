Lower the bar in a controlled manner to your mid-chest, keeping your elbows at about a 45-degree angle. Press the bar back up explosively while maintaining a slight arch in your lower back and keeping your shoulder blades retracted throughout the movement. This is the fundamental compound movement for building overall chest mass and strength.",
